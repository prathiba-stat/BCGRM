Bayesian Cross-classified Graded Response Models
This module helps you fit a Bayesian Graded Response Model (GRM) and a Bayesian Cross-classified GRM
Where the teachers are cross-classified with students
The data is also available as a csv file for download
Please download both files and execute only one model at a time.
If the program seems to hang, do not worry. It just takes a long time to compute
Hence, my word of caution to execute only one model at a time.
Make sure you download and install Jags, RJAGS, and runjags prior to running the All models.R file

Change the working directory to your current folder where you have stored the csv file all-students-not-reversed.
Lets say the folder is C:/foo, then add this path within quotes on line 2 of the All models.R file
